# Matched Filter PyCUDA
GPU-parallelised implementation of a matched filter algorithm.

This project features a parallelised version of the matched filter algorithm proposed in [this repository](https://github.com/luibo/matched-filter-py).

The parallelization is performed at GPU level by using PyCUDA.
